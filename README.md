### Problem solving and differentiate with existing solutions
* __Problem 1:__ Due to COVID-19, not only humans but also dogs have social relationship restrictions.
* __Solution 1:__ Do you want to go to a dog cafe or dog park to develop your dog's sociality and activity, but are you afraid of COVID-19? Our application has a small-scale regional matching system. Find dog owners near you and develop your dog's sociality and activity. 

* __Problem 2:__ Dog owners are concerned that their puppies can be attacked by other larger dogs while walking or in a dog cafe.
* __Solution 2:__ Are you worried that your puppy might be attacked by another big puppy? Our application is classified into large dogs, medium dogs, and small dogs, so dog owners can find and match dogs of the category they want. In addition, since owners can see the profile and photos of the other dogs, they can match more safely.

* __Problem 3:__ Users may be concerned that the other dog owners may be a dangerous or a strange person.
* __Solution 3:__ In this case, if the user matches with another dog owner, he or she can check the other person's reviews, manner scores, and the accumulated state of reporting to make matching more safe.

__→__ A Social Networking Service for the dog owners which provides the share in walking routes for dogs, information community for the dogs, and finding the local companion dogs who want to have a walk together.  
The main functions(primary tasks) of our service expects to be similar to this application which targets the dog owners who want to socialize with the other dog owners for their dogs to meet other companion dogs (especially for a walk).

__→__ The service provides customized information about dog-friendly places by classifying the dogs into their sizes(large, medium and small) which enables the users to choose where their dogs fit the most.  
Our service is also planning to specify the information about dogs by classifying into various categories which can give the users more detailed and customized information.


### Process to find the target
* Find dog owners who want to walk their dog with other companion dogs and communicate with other dog owners around us and interview them in person.

* We can interview a few dog owners in person meeting to collect qualitative data and online survey to collect quantitative data.
